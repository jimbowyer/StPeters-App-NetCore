<h2>Joyful Mysteries</h2>
<h3>1. The Annunciation </h3>    
<p>The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth. And coming to Mary, he said, "Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you." (Lk 1:26-28) </p>   
<h3>2. The Visitation </h3>    
<p>Mary set out and traveled to the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice and said, "Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb." (Lk 1:39-45) <br /></p>   
<h3>3. The Birth of Our Lord </h3>    
<p>And Mary gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger . . . And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying: "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests." (Lk 2:1-20) <br /></p> 
<h3>4. The Presentation in the Temple </h3>    
<p>Mary and Joseph took the baby Jesus to the Temple to present him to the Lord. At the temple Simeon and Anna came forward, gave thanks to God and spoke about Jesus to all who were present. (Lk 2:22-38) <br /><br /></p>  
<h3>5. The Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple </h3>
