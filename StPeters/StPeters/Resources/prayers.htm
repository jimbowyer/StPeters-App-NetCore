    <h2>Prayers of the Rosary</h2>      
    <p><b>Apostles’ Creed:</b> I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried.  He descended into hell.  On the third day He rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.  From there He will come to judge the living and the dead.  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.  Amen.</p>         
    <p><b>Our Father</b> who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  Amen.</p>
    <p><b>Hail Mary,</b> full of grace, the Lord is with you.  Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.  Amen.</p>
    <p><b>Glory be to the Father,</b> and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.  As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.  Amen.</p>
    <p><b>The Fatima Prayer:</b> Oh my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell.  Lead all souls to heaven, especially those most in need of Thy mercy.</p>
    <p><b>Hail Holy Queen,</b> Mother of Mercy!  Our life, our sweetness and our hope.  To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.  Turn then most gracious Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.<br/>
      V. Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God,<br/>
      R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.<br/>
      V. Let us pray<br/>
      R. O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal salvation; grant, we beseech You, that meditating upon these mysteries of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ our Lord.  Amen.</p>
    <p><b>St. Michael, the Archangel,</b> defend us in battle.  Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil.  May God rebuke him, we humbly pray and do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the power of God, cast into hell, Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl throughout the world, seeking the ruin of souls.  Amen.</p>
