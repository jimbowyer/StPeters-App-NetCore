    <h2>Sorrowful Mysteries</h2>
    <h3>1. The Agony in the Garden </h3>    
    <p>Jesus went to a place called Gethsemane to pray. "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will." (Mt 26:36-46) </p>    
    <h3>2. The Scourging at the Pillar </h3>    
    <p>The chief priests with the elders and the scribes held a council. They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, had Jesus scourged and handed him over to be crucified. (Mk 15:1-16) </p>    
    <h3>3. The Crowning with Thorns </h3>    
    <p>They stripped off his clothes and threw a scarlet military cloak about him. Weaving a crown out of thorns, they placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" (Mt 27:27-31) </p>    
    <h3>4. The Carrying of the Cross </h3>    
    <p>Jesus, weak from being beaten, was unable to carry His cross to Golgotha alone. Simon, a Cyrenian, helped him. (Mk 15:20-22) </p>    
    <h3>5. The Crucifixion </h3>    
    <p>When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left. Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do." (Lk 23:33-46)</p>
